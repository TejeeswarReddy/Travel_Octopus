              Work part time<br>
              Want to travel when you are 16, 18, 20 or any other age? Get a job. I know many parents tend to be against part time jobs when you are young, but look online. Cut down all that time you spend on Facebook and Whatsapp, and learn a skill like video editing, social media management or coding, create a simple portfolio of your work, and write to small companies with your work samples. You’ll earn some money to travel, and experiment with work you could do professionally in the future… win-win.<br><br>
              Keep an eye out for travel opportunities<br>
              Don’t get too cozy in your comfort zone. Keep your eyes and ears open, and try to grab any kind of travel opportunities that come your way.Follow brands in your field of interest on Instagram, join Facebook and Google groups that share such opportunities, and don’t let anyone tell you that you won’t make it.Look for courses and internships that involve traveling.<br><br>
              Look for courses and internships that involve traveling<br>
              Depending on what you’re studying, you could look at organisations like Aiesec, which offer international internships; join Facebook groups that share unique opportunities from around the world (like Youth Opportunities); and dig deep on google to find others like you who added travel to their life at a young age. The point is to plunge into the endless pool of information online and find the opportunities you need.<br><br>
              Explore your own country<br>
              So if you’re really itching to travel and manage to save a little bit of money, pick a place in your own country, do some research and travel with an open mind… you’ll always wonder why you waited so long!<br><br>
              Chill… you have your whole life to chase your dream!<br>
               I know this is the last thing you want to hear when you’re a teenager and raring to go, but hey, you have your whole life to chase your dream to travel (or whatever it is that you want to do). Work on your skills, deepen your understanding of your options, take baby steps whenever you can, stay patient… but no matter what happens, don’t buy into the world’s greatest lie:
               <br><br><i>“What is the world’s greatest lie?” the little boy asks.<br><br>

               The old man replies, “It’s this: that at a certain point in our lives, we lose control of what’s happening to us, and our lives become controlled by fate. That’s the world’s greatest lie.”</i>

           <h2><i>"What It’s Like to Travel Solo When<br> You’re in a Relationship"</i></h2>
           <p><i>When people read about my solo travel adventures, they often assume that I travel alone because I'm single.</i></p>

              At first, travelling solo while in a relationship sucks<br>
              I won’t lie to you: the first few days are the hardest. You’re trying to figure out life by yourself, while at the same time, probably trying to figure out the new place you’re in. When you notice an oddity or feel the rush of excitement surging through your body, there is no familiar person to share that feeling with.<br><br>
              You end up talking to more people, even as an introvert<br>
              Or should I say, more people end up talking to you? I guess in a way, it helps that solo travellers still stand out like an oddity in most parts of the world.And needless to say, the more locals we talk to and hang out with on our travels, the more adventures we’re likely to get ourselves into.<br><br>
              You start valuing your partner more<br>
              I think it’s only human to take someone you spend a lot of time with, for granted. You don’t hold back getting mad at someone you’re always with, or failing to acknowledge how important they are in your life. I know many relationships that have deteriorated over time that way.Besides, the road is a great teacher. And among other things, it keeps teaching me that life is too short and unpredictable to spend some of it fighting with someone you love.<br><br>
              Travelling solo while in a relationship can change you in unexpected ways<br>
              Travelling alone, especially for a long period of time, has certainly helped me gain confidence in myself, build my self-esteem and value my independence – especially as a young, unmarried girl from small town India.That I can be emotionally sufficient and dependent at the same time. That I can chase my dreams without guilt, and yet have a shoulder to cry on if I crash along the way.<br><br>
              The going is easier when you have someone to trust on the other end!<br>
               There are so many fears, hopes, expectations and disappointments on the road that I just can’t explain it to my family or friends. But having experienced some of them together, I can trust that there is someone I can call who will understand what I’m going through. That when I find myself disappointed or overwhelmed by a place, I will only hear words of encouragement, not worry or panic. That when I want to shorten a trip or walk away from an adventure because I just can’t convince myself to go through with it, I will only hear words of support, not judgement.
               <br><br><i>Luckily, these beautiful words penned by Che came to my rescue:<br><br>

               “Farewell, my only one<br>
                Do not tremble before the hungry wolves<br>
                Nor in the cold steppes of absence<br>
                I take you with me in my heart<br>
                And we will continue together until the road vanishes…”</i>

           <p><i>A chance to explore remote corners of India virtually, through the words, photos and videos of the very people...</i></p>
           <img src="https://i2.wp.com/the-shooting-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FullSizeRender.jpg?resize=1536%2C1152&ssl=1">

             A few months ago, I embarked on an unexpected journey to explore rural India. I walked precariously on a centuries-old hanging wooden bridge (only 5 remain to this day!) that connect the most remote villages of Ladakh’s Zanskar Valley. Witnessed the intimate love stories of four generations of women in a remote Uttarakhand village. Joined the ancient tradition of worshipping wild tigers in rural Maharashtra. Walked several kilometers in Kerala’s Wayanad district with a 63-year-old “walking library” who delivers books to those who love to read but have no access. Learnt how the tribal culture in Meghalaya’s South Garo Hills is helping preserve local biodiversity. And tried lost ancient superfoods with a 70+ year old Himachali couple…<br><br>
             All without stepping out!<br><br>
              Can we really explore rural India without leaving home?:<br>
              Exactly a year ago, I was pacing up and down my terrace in Dehradun, feeling deeply concerned about how India’s tourism industry – especially community based tourism in India – was going to survive the pandemic-induced lockdown. I longingly recalled many heartwarming moments I had shared with homestay hosts, guides, dhaba owners, craftspeople, natural medicine practitioners, musicians, local environmentalists and others over the past decade, on my quest to explore India beyond the beaten path.<br><br>

              <i>The Forbidden Forests of Meghalaya</i>:<br> A social worker from Meghalaya’s Chiringmagre village shares how ancient traditions and tribal culture help preserve a patch of pristine biodiversity in Meghalaya’s South Garo Hills.<br>
